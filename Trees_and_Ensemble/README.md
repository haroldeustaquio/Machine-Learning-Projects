## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main categories, each focusing on specific tasks and datasets:

- **Classification Projects**: Includes projects that apply decision tree and ensemble models to classification tasks. [See more](classification/README.md)

- **Regression Projects**: Contains projects that use decision tree and ensemble models for regression tasks. [See more](regression/README.md)

Each subfolder has a detailed README with descriptions of the datasets, models used, and project-specific results.
