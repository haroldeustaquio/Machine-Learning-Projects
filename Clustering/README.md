# Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Projects

This repository contains projects focused on clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques applied to different datasets. The projects aim to explore how well various clustering methods perform, especially when paired with dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Projects

### 1. Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Clustering using PCA
This project clusters breast cancer diagnostic data using K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce the dataset's dimensionality for better visualization and clustering accuracy. Models were evaluated using silhouette score, adjusted Rand index, and V-measure.

**Dataset**: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)

### 2. Clustering on the Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset, a classic in machine learning, was clustered using K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering. The goal was to identify natural clusters of flowers based on characteristics like petal and sepal dimensions. Evaluation metrics include silhouette score, adjusted Rand index, and Davies-Bouldin score.

**Dataset**: [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
