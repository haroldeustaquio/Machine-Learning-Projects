# Linear Regression Mini-Projects

This repository contains several mini-projects that apply regression models to various datasets. Each project demonstrates the application of these techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Projects

### 1. Beer Consumption Prediction
This project predicts beer consumption in liters based on weather data such as temperature, precipitation, and whether the day is a weekend. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and R², with visualizations such as scatter plots and residual plots to aid in understanding the predictions.

Dataset: [Beer Consumption in São Paulo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robintux/Datasets4StackOverFlowQuestions/master/Consumo_cerveza_SP.csv)

### 2. Personal Insurance Cost Prediction
Focusing on predicting personal insurance costs, this project utilizes features like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The models were assessed using RMSE, MAPE, and R² scores, showing comparable performance, with Linear Regression slightly outperforming the other model.

Dataset: [Personal Insurance Cost Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robintux/Datasets4StackOverFlowQuestions/master/CostoPersonalesSeguros.csv)

### 3. Water Temperature Prediction Using Oceanographic Data
This project aims to predict water temperature using oceanographic measurements. Accuracy of predictions based on salinity, oxygen levels, and depth was evaluated, indicating that one model performed better than the other for this dataset.

Dataset: [CalCOFI "bottle" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi)

### 4. Weather Prediction During World War II
This analysis examines weather data from World War II to understand its impact on historical events. The goal is to predict maximum temperature based on various weather conditions, including data cleaning, feature selection, and evaluation of model performance.

Dataset: [WeatherWW2 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smid80/weatherww2/data)

### 5. Weather prediction in Szeged 2006-2016
Investigating the relationship between humidity and apparent temperature, this project predicts apparent temperature using weather data from Szeged. The models showed strong performance, particularly one that achieved an R² score of 0.990.

Dataset: [Szeged Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/budincsevity/szeged-weather)
